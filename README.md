📌 Project Overview

Built an end-to-end dynamic pricing system combining machine learning, price elasticity modeling, and inventory simulation to optimize airline pricing decisions. Delivered insights through interactive Power BI dashboards, enabling executives to explore fare trends, competitive positioning, and revenue optimization strategies.

📌 Key Components
1. Machine Learning Fare Prediction

    Model: LightGBM Regressor
    
    Predicts average ticket fare using route, seasonality, airline, and competitor data.
    
    Performance: MAE ≈ $13.2

2. Price Elasticity Modeling

    Simulated fare multipliers (0.8 → 1.2) to estimate demand sensitivity.
    
    Identified optimal pricing zone around 0.9–1.0 multiplier, where revenue peaks.

3. Inventory-Aware Pricing Simulation
  
      Modeled how price and demand change based on booking window (0–90 days) and seats remaining.
      
      Generated revenue & demand heatmaps to reduce spoilage and optimize load factor.
  
  4. Power BI Dashboards

  Three fully interactive dashboards:
    
    1. Historical & Predicted Fare Analysis
      
    2. Elasticity-Based Pricing Simulator
      
    3. Inventory-Driven Dynamic Pricing Simulator

📌 Key Insights
  
    Revenue uplift potential: 10–14% with optimized price multipliers.
    
    Spoilage reduction: 30–40% via inventory-aware dynamic pricing.
    
    Seasonal peaks: Apr–Sep, troughs: Oct–Dec.
    
    Competitor prices strongly influence predicted fare and optimal strategy.

📌 Business Impact

This project demonstrates how airlines can integrate ML + elasticity + inventory simulation to optimize fares, improve competitiveness, and increase revenue while reducing empty seats.
